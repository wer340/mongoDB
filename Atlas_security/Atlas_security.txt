1---C.I.A  traid *confidentiality *integrity *availability

===confidentiality
Akin to privacy it mean information is accessed only when authorized 
âœ…RBAC role based access control
the ablity to indentify specific user

===integrity
ensure data isnt modified without authorization 

=== availability
no interruption even in the face of an attempted network intrusion

2--- AAA Authentication Authorization Accounting
two diffrent approach to authentication user crdential and runs 
its own credintial valdition is the process of a user proving their identity
and the other  external -->mongodb integrate with a trusted system often called identity provider
in this case we can see that Atlas is checking an LDAP server to attest the user identity 
user prove their identity to deter party provider which  then attests that identity to mongodb
this allows you to enforce more complex authentication policies or leverage exisitig authentication system
---Authentication -->
password
Token
FingerPrint
SCRAM SHA-256 hashing algoritm
for external authnitecation mechanizm  used two authenticatiom   LDAP or x509 certifiacate
----Authorozation -->controls who can perform actions
check permision and perfom
how an identity after being validated can perform actionas that are being granted to them 
RBAC privilage that define 
in mongodb  you can both define your particular set of role by creating a new user define role
or use any of pre-exsiting role
----Accounting  -->is logging the activity of users
allows the database to keep track of user acions
