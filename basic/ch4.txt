1---query operators: comparison
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin"
 what query operators have in common with all kinds of operators is the dollar sign that preceds the operator
the dollar sign is used for multiple things in mongodb ✔operators ✔aggregaation pipline stage and ✔accessing field
comparison operators
$eq = equal to     $ne = Not Equal

$gt > greater than    $lt  < less than
$gte >=  greater than or equal to  $lte  <= less than or equal to
{<field>:{<operator>:<value>}}

2---logic operator
$and ==> match all of the specified query clauses and default operator can be write as  {❤,❤,❤}
 $or ==> aat least one of the query claauses is matched▶ {$and|$or|$nor:[{❤},{❤},{❤}]}    
 $nor ==> fail maatch both given clauses
 $not==> negates the query requirement{$not:{}}
$and is used as the deafult operator when an operator is not specified just like we discussed the deafult presence of equal
when issuing a query similar aalogic works for $and 
explicit and 
when combine   and  or  at moment we explicit     {$and:[{$or:[{❤},{❤},{❤}]},{$or:[{❤},{❤},{❤}]}]}
and combine with comparison operators  means 
{$and:[{$or:[{❤},{❤},{❤}]},{$or:[{❤},{❤},{❤}]}],"pop":{$lte:100000}}

Expressive query operator
$expr its expressive  meaning it  can do more than one simple operation it allow the use of aggregation expression
within the query language and it uses this syntax  also allow  us to use variable and conditional statement
can we compare field within the same document to each other ? yes 
db.trips.find({ "$expr": { "$eq": [ "$end station id", "$start station id"] }
              }).count()
find doc thats start and end pont same 
✔✔ dollar sign in array for each field  a lot of wondeful [ "$end station id", "$start station id"]
the dollar sign symbol has a lot of wonderful superpowers in MQL
one of them is to denote when you are using an operator 
another one is to signify that you are looking at the value of the field  if dont use $ sign  comapare  specific name field rather than value
comparison operator applay later  in case with logic operator
"pop":{$eq:1000}   MQL syntax
{$eq:["$pop",1000]} Aggregation syntax
both them same way with slightly different
we will cover aggregation pipline and operator   explain this different
✅✅✅✅notice : "expr"  essentially  for  compare  two field of same doc 

4---Array Operators
so far we queried documents by fields that have string numric and boolean values
 its time that we look at more complex elements and see what MQL has to offer to query array fields
we already learned one array operator $push which allows us to add an element to an array 
or turn a field into an array field if it was previously a different type
samaple_airbnb
when in doc     amenities:[ 1,2,3,,4,5,5]   for ✔find({amenities:1})    ❌find({amenities:[1]}) exact match means look for 
a amenities field thats exactly one array  [1]
jsut question does order field matter in query ? yes order does matter 
find all documents that contain more than one amenity whithout carring about the order od array element 
MQL has a great operator for that called $all 
this query shuld return all docs that haave at least these elements in the amenities field 
if dont wante doc that more than value   caan $size operator limit your match
projection :
a projection allows us to decide which doc field will be part of the resulting in cursor(type of pointer for save in memory)
5--- projection
we see doc  with lots of field that  often dont fit on the screen to mitigate this we can add a projection to our find queries
and only look at field that we are  intersted in at the moment 
find({query},{field:1},{field:0})   id by deafult :1    1 fetch   0 dont fetch 
so this is a valid prjection because the 0 is used to explicitly exclude the default _id value 
if sub document we want specific data  how  can we access elements in these sub document of an array
there is  a handy array operator ✅ $elemMatch  find({},{"score":{"$eleMatch":{"score":{"$gt":85}}}) 
in the score array a field that is called type  and value for the type is extra credit there is no projection
▶ find({},{"score":{"$eleMatch":{"type":"extra credit"}}) 
in this query this student really needed extra credit so its good thing that they got it for this class 
so its a good thing that they got it for this class sice elemMatch is being used in the query part the result
 is the full doc that matches the condition for at least one of the elements in the array 
6---querying arrays and sub-documents
mongodb has a flexible model for storing data which mean  that developer get to decide how to best store their data
trip collections
first we want to know how to get  to the array field in those nested docs  for that 
✅MQL uses something called dot-notation  lets look at it in action 
✔✔✔in array element nested doc  dot notation with index   ✅fieldname.0.field.2.field:""   
array elements in most languages and data structure are enumerated starting from zero mongo db is no deffrent
so the  for check element use $regex operator
when will search ethrough every array element and document there is field called is past {"is-past":true}
which can tell us whether this person is still with the company so if they left the value should be true
