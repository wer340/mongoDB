1---insert data
go to GUI collection    insert button
notice : every document must have a unique _id value from the rest of the document 
objectId()-->dafult avalue for the _id field unless otherwise specified
doesnt haave to type objectid it is just  what is created by deafult to ensure uniqe value 
for each document
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/ObjectId/#objectid
2---
db.inspections.findOne()  one result retuen otherwise even though many result matched with this filter
awe cant  insert documents with identical _id 
✔mongodb allows to have same doc  but different _id
mongodb also  allow  dont have same doc if you choose to mange your database
to place restriction on the doc content that isa being inserted you can check out mongodb schema
mongoimport --uri="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" sales.json
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin"
use sample_training
db.inspections.findOne();
with insert can ass multiple document   if suronded aquare bracket []  insert([{},{},{}])
if insert  two doc  with same id   mongo give id to first doc 
3----
insert([{{_id:1,name:"test1"},{_id:1,name:"test2"}])  ❌test2 not store
in many doc insert  mongo behavir by order store
if want not all   doc insert without duplicate error[skip]   can be add  ✅insert( [{}{}],{"ordered":false})
✔when the default orderd insert happense the moment there is a duplicate key error the insert opreation halt
and even if the rest of ✅the document have unique IDs they wont get a chanse to be insert 
if the insert ✅is unorderd then every document that has a unique underscore id value get
added to the collection 
mongodb want simple for same reson  if collection not maded  first make one then store data into  it
if ▶use newname    is made db with name will become part of my atlas cluster  but if i dont do anything
and go back to take look at all of db with ▶show dbs then this new name db should not be there
since there is no data assocoated with it  ✅
db.inspections.insert([{ "_id": 1, "test": 1 },{ "_id": 1, "test": 2 },
                       { "_id": 3, "test": 3 }],{ "ordered": false }) ✅order asecond arg
▶show collections
▶show dbs

4---update Gui
pencill button    first  filter doc then edit  {"classa_id":339,"student_id":151}

5--mongodb query lang    MQL
upateOne updateMany
One   ---  Many
updateOne -->  if exist many doc with this filter property   ✔update one of them
db.zips.updateMany({ "city": "HUDSON" }, { "$inc": { "pop": 10 } })  //example pop was 12000  know is be 12010  plus 10
first arg the query which will determine which documents will be updated  
second argument specifies the update that needs to happen 
we are using $inc [increment]which is an MQL update opreator it increment the value of a specified field  ✅by the given amount
so in this case we are looking to increment the pop field by 10  in every document which lists "HUDSON"  as city
✅$inc syntax allows us to update multiple fields at the same time 
$inc not only update opreator in the mongodb query 
✔if we try to use the $inc opreator then we will have to find the current population value then substract that from
thr actual population and then increment by that aamount that sound exhusting insted we will use 
✅the $set opreator
db.zips.updateOne({ "zip": "12534" }, { "$set": { "pop": 17630 } })
if field not exist  $set opreator make this field
✅push
✅$pull remove field from array
adds an elemet to an array field like $set opreator if field not exist   first is made field then add vaalue
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/update/#id1
✅$unset  remove field { $unset: { <field1>: "", ... } }
5----deleting
best way afor delete _id adress till reach own risk to low
db.inspections.deleteOne({ "test": 3 })
✅✅db.collection.drop()   remove collection
db.inspection.drop()
✔✔Does removing all collections in a database also remove the database? yes
